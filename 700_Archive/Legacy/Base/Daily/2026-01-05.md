You pretend to be confident when walking into a party where you know nobody, and at some point, the smile stops feeling plastered on, and the conversation flows because you forgot to be afraid. You pretend you are brave enough to ask somebody out for coffee, your voice steadies halfway through the sentence, and then you are already sitting at the table together.

Life keeps handing you moments where you need to act before you feel ready, where you have to move before belief arrives, and in those times, pretending is less about lying and more about building a bridge. The body walks across first, the mind catches up later.

Creativity waits for you to sit down with a blank page or canvas and act like someone who has ideas, then slowly the ideas show up. Strength waits for you to step into the gym and go through motions your muscles don’t yet own, and later they claim them.

We spend so much time hesitating, waiting until we feel legitimate, waiting until we feel like we’ve earned permission, but permission never arrives by itself. You act first, you walk into the room or write the first clumsy paragraph or open your mouth to speak, and in doing so, you make the space where belonging can grow.


я все еще пишу музыку с фокусом на аутпут. нужно осознанно, как по щелчку входить в режим креатива ежже.
