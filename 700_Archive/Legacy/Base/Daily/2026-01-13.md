"Conquering the world isn’t about flexing like some wannabe emperor; it’s about moving through life so smooth and calculated that the wins pile up before anyone realizes you were even playing. Power that doesn’t need to shout is the loudest kind.  
  
Humility? That’s the cheat code. Without it, you end up drunk on your own ego; big crown, empty kingdom. With it, you get to keep building, keep scheming, keep surprising. It’s knowing the world can humble you in a heartbeat, so you laugh, adapt, and keep swinging anyway."
