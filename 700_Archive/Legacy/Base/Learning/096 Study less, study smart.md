# Rules
00:15 –  1) Don't study for too long if you are not enjoying it. Take short breaks of 5mins after 20-30 minutes.
07:50 –  2  Reward system
10:19 –  3) Dedicated study area (Behavior Reinforcement), Don't study in the living room, bedroom, etc. Study in a separate place dedicated to studying. Special desk/ room for studying/working
19:49 –  4) Rote memorization vs. Active learning. Don't try to memorize without understanding. Try to understand the concept first. (be able to explain things in your own words)
32:49 –  5) Don't always study alone. Studying in groups helps a lot.
33:58 –  6) Highlighting books (Recognition vs. Recollection) 
36:37 –  7) Don't highlight text blindly. Highlighting doesn't help that much. It only indicates Recognization not Recollection of the topic. (Recognition vs. Recollection) 
36:57 –  8)  Sleep is so important for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep. (REM  Sleep)

41:20 – 10) Active Recitation, Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning.
43:22 – 11) Study from books, Use the SQ3R(survey, question, read, recite, review) method while studying. 20% reading 80% reciting
47:42 – 12) Use Mnemonics. It's the best way to memorize facts.  (Acronyms, Coin Sayings, Interactive Images)--
