> Sow a thought and you reap an action;sow an act and you reap a habit;soe a habit and you reap a character;sow a character and you reap a destiny.(Ralph Waldo Emerson)

# Steps
1. Sow a thought
Выбор цели,миссии жизни. Выберите что то трудное,что интересно вам. 
Преследование сложной цели улучшает нас,учит нас многому.
2. Sow an action. 
Действовать даже тогда,когда не хочется. Заниматься тем,что ннужно сделать здесь и сейчас.

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

> Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

> No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.” (Steve Jobs)
