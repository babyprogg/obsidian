## 3 key points on asking and receiving

1. Asking is the beginning of receiving. 
2. Receiving is not the problem
	Failure to ask is might be the one of your major problems. 
3. Receiving is like the ocean, theres a plenty. 
### 2 ways to ask
1. Ask with intelligence. 
	Dont mumble, you dont get anything by mumbling. Be clear, be specific. Define and describe what you want. Once you describe your wants/goals they pull like magnet. The more clear is more they pull. 
2. Ask with faith. 
	Make plans like an adult and believe in them like a child.
