# Two Systems
We have two systems to regulate our work, wake and sleep (sleep-wake regulation). 
## They work process
The way it works is — the wake system actually sends out signals, putting the brain in active alert mode. This is the reason why we wake up in the morning and stay awake during daytime. The sleep system, on the other hand, sends signals that help us fall asleep and stay asleep during the night time.

*Scientificaly*
In more technical terms, the tendency to sleep in humans is regulated by a fine balance between wake-promoting neurotransmitter systems and sleep-promoting neurotransmitter systems. In order to facilitate sleep, a group of neurons in the hypothalamus *known as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO)* release *galanin and GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid, or γ-aminobutyric acid)* the inhibitory neurotransmitters to stop the wake system.

### Primary Insomnia
Insomnia was believed to be caused by other conditions such as stress, anxiety, schizophrenia, and depression. This type of insomnia was categorised as [primary insomnia](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/inso/) by medical practitioners.

#### Models behind Primary Insomnia
*3P Model* - Predisposing, Perpetuating, and Precipitating. Also known as the Spielman model of chronic insomnia.

**Predisposing(предрасполагающий)**
As per this model, predisposing factors can cause occasional instances of poor sleep at night, but in general, the person sleeps well until a precipitating event ( for e.g., passing away of a loved one) occurs, which actually triggers acute insomnia.
In case the person develops bad sleep habits or other perpetuating factors set in; insomnia becomes chronic and persists even after the removal of the precipitating factor.

*Cognitive model*
This model suggests that insomniacs (people suffering from the condition) are extremely worried about sleep and the consequences of not having enough it. This kind of thought pattern triggers stress and arousal, thus increasing anxiety and sleep problems as they tend to actively monitor their environment for sleep-related issues such as body sensations, disturbing noises, etc.

*Neurocognitive model*
As per this model, people with insomnia are seen with more high-frequency electrical activity in the brain (EEG) during sleep time when compared with other normal sleepers. This kind of cortical arousal indicates enhanced sensory or information processing in insomniacs, causing acute sleep problems.
